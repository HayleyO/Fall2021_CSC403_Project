#CF \\data\\foreground\\ msgreen.png Green: Yeah, I got through it so fast! Such a great ending. I can’t wait for the next book in the series!
#CT I’m so glad to see you, actually. There’s something I want to ask you… but I--I just can’t get up the nerve! I’m sorry. I don’t mean to bother you. 
#CF \\data\\foreground\\ player.png Mr. Peanut: Well, I was actually wondering… did you want to go to brand prom with me?
#CF \\data\\foreground\\ msgreen.png Green: Oh!! I can’t believe it! You really mean that? Nobody’s ever asked me to prom before. 
#CF \\data\\foreground\\ player.png Mr. Peanut: Of course I mean it! I'd love to go with you!
#CF \\data\\foreground\\ msgreen.png Green: Oh! Well thank you so much!! I--I’d absolutely love to go. Thank you for asking!!

#CBF \\data\\background\\ forestnight.jpg \\data\\foreground\\ msgreen.png Green: I love all the sounds at night. The owls, the crickets, the rustling of the breeze in the leaves… and the stars…!
#CF \\data\\foreground\\ player.png Mr. Peanut:  It’s all so beautiful. 
#CF \\data\\foreground\\ msgreen.png Green: Yes…! I’m… I’m so happy. Thanks for bringing me out here. This is lovely. 
#CF \\data\\foreground\\ player.png Mr. Peanut: I wouldn’t have spent the night any other way.
