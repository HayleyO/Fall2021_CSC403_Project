#CT Hayley: Excuse me, do you have eyes? Can you see? 
#CT Mr. Peanut: I think so? If this isn’t the cafeteria, then where am I? 
#CT Hayley: The best place to lose money at. I’ve got all sorts of useless items to buy. I noticed you have a monocle. You seem to be a man of wealth. I know exactly how to fix that problem. 
#CT Mr. Peanut: Oh, I’m sorry, I don’t have any money right now. 
#CT Hayley: Don’t we all? Isn’t that just the way life works? Come back when you do. I’d like to fix the no money problem myself.
