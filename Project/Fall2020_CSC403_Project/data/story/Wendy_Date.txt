#CT Wendy: At long last.
#CT Wendy: The last component of this ancient ritual. . . Lost to me for thousands of years. 
#CT Wendy: Mr. Peanut, the magic is stronger if we have two participants. Would you be willing to perform the ritual with me? 
#CF \\data\\foreground\\ player.png Mr. Peanut: Of course!
#HF [INSERT LATIN CHANTING]
#SF Mr. Peanut: The soul is glowing…!
#CF \\data\\foreground\\ wendy.png Wendy: Yes, yes, yes, at long last!
#CF \\data\\foreground\\ player.png Mr. Peanut: Oh no! It’s gone! Where did it go? What happened to it?
#CF \\data\\foreground\\ wendy.png Wendy: That’s for me to know and you to find out. Suffice to say… the ritual was a success. Its effects will finally begin to show themselves on Saturday at the prom. I look forward to it… 
#CF \\data\\foreground\\ player.png Mr. Peanut: It was nice spending time with you Wendy! I’m glad I could help.
#CF \\data\\foreground\\ wendy.png Wendy: Yes, you have helped so much. Thank you. I am forever in your debt.
