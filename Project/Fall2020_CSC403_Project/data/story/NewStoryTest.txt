#CT Okay we've successfully read in a new story
#CT Whew
#CT So the way this works is, this story gets added to the end of whatever was read in before
#CT So keep in mind that whatever was read in before will happen before this does

#CT You've now seen what is possible.
#CT Coding is miserable.
#CT Let's do a very short demo.

#CB \\data\\background\\ opening.jpg Oh boy, it's my first day at brand school.
#CT Oh look! It's my P.E. teacher, Mr. Koolaid Man.
#CF \\data\\foreground\\ enemy_koolaid.png Mr. Koolaid Man: "Hello peanut man, hope you're enjoying November."
#CT Hmm, that's odd, why would I be enjoying november.
#CT Maybe we shouldn't have let Hayley push this weird wacky story in lieu of the fully written episodes we have so far.
#CT Oh well, it IS only a bite of what's been developed.
#CT Hayley sure is cool, anyways. Cooler than Kool-Aid, which has "cool" in the name. 
#CF \\data\\foreground\\ player.png You: "Hello, sir, of course I'm enjoying this november."
#CT Okay okay, you get it, the game is gonna crash now cause actually closing the window is too much for lazy old me to bother with at the moment.
